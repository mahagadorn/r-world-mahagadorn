#'In this lesson we will be simulating moving animals into our ecosystem
#'Our herbivores are going to be eating our plants created in the last session
#'the effects of our herbivores on our plant populations will be quite dramatic
#'
#'THREE LIFE HISTORY PARAMETERS FOR OUR HERBIVORES
    #' Probabilites for:
        #' eating a plant 
        #' killing a plant when they eat
        #' reproducing once they have eaten
    #'Herbivores wont feed every time-step
    #'When they don't feed they're going to move
    #'Whether an herbivore feeds or not will be related to how long since they have last fed
    #'IF THEY GO TOO LONG WITHOUT FEEDING THEY WILL DIE
#' we need to make sure that we give some DEEP though to what DATA STRUCTURE we use to store our herbivores
